# WIP Merge check Plugin

The purpose of the plugin is to provide a merge check that prevents merging a pull request in case if pull request title contains 'WIP:' substring. The Merge Check is implemented as a hook accessible under the Merge Checks section in the Project/Repo admin UI. The Merge Check is configurable on both Project and Repository level, following the same structure as the Bitbucket native Merge checks.

# Development

In order to rebuild the plugin use the Atlassian SDK

Here are the SDK commands you’ll use immediately:

-   atlas-run   – installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
-   atlas-debug – same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
-   atlas-cli   – after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
    \- ‘pi’ reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
-   atlas-help  – prints description for all commands in the SDK
